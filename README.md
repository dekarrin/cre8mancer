# cre8orforge

A silly little idler that is themed around the creative process. It's intended to
be integrated with Discord bots or other text-chat clients, but it is very much playable
on its own.

Eventually, it is planned to have expanding gameplay that unfolds in 3 stages; the
first is the starting 'clicker' idler, the second is a gacha training game based
around the completion of a high-tier activity from the first stage, and the third
builds on grown gacha that assemble into groups and help you attain goals on a
galactic scale.

For now, focus is on the first stage; we want a good solid first game mode before
expanding.

## Goals

* Be playable and fun to use over a text-based chat client
* Make it fun to participate outside the game in a chat community

Another goal:

* Never ever charge a cent of real world money

8asically we got really fed up with shitty game mechanics preying on human psychology to pull money outta them,
shit's disgusting as hell. We 8nt goin down that route, get fucked 8efore we do that shit.

Cre8orForge will 8e free as in 8eer and free as in freedom for as long as we can legally ensure that this is the
case. We will *never* allow any microtransaction that reel-world money can be used for.
